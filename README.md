# CS482_FinalProject
The final project for CS482, Machine Learning. Uses scikit-learn to create and work with various classification methods, including Logistic Regression models, k-Nearest Neighbors models, Neural Network models, and Support Vector Machine models.

## Requirements
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## Running the programs
Run the Python file with your desired model and dataset in a terminal.

Example with Carnegie Mellon University data: `python3 SupportVectorMachine_ExperimentData.py`

Example with our data: `python3 SupportVectorMachine_CollectedData.py`
